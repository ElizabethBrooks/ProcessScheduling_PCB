#ProcessScheduling_PCB


Lab 5: "Given a binary file containing PCB (Process Control Block) information about multiple
processes –written in sequential order, 
simulate a CPU scheduling using different scheduling
algorithms. The time quantum is 1. 
After “executing” one process, the current status of each
process should be written in the same file. 
The process should be repeated until each process is
finished (no more burst time). 
The binary file is to be downloaded from the website."
